# Heat-transfer-analysis-of-a-square-block-using-ADI-technique-for-temperature-distribution
Projects completed as part of the Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (ME634) course at IIT Kanpur. These projects encompass various simulations and analyses, demonstrating proficiency in numerical methods, turbulence modeling, and computational techniques in fluid dynamics.

This project involves analyzing the heat transfer in a metallic square block using the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) technique. The block, initially at a uniform temperature, is exposed to a cooler environment, and the temperature distribution is computed after 60 seconds. The problem is modeled with a grid mesh and solved numerically to understand the heat dissipation process.
